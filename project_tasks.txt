1.
From the terminal, list the Git branches.
- git branch

2.
Kay wasnâ€™t sure where she wanted to host the party, so you made several Git branches to explore different locations.

Some of the branches are no longer needed. Delete the following branches:

moma
whitney 
- git branch -d moma, whitney

3.
Kay wants to see a version of the webpage that includes an unordered list with bullet points instead of a paragraph to show information about the party.

Create a new branch called unordered-list and switch over to it.
- git branch unordered-list
- git checkout unordered-list

4.
In index.html, replace:

<p>Description: Join Kay in celebrating their 29th birthday with free food and beverages, karaoke and a special appearance by Willy Nelson. Also, feel free to explore the Met museum before or after you stop by! Presents for Kay optional.</p>

with this unordered list:

<ul>
    <li>Join Kay in celebrating their 29th birthday with free food and beverages</li>
    <li>karaoke and a special appearance by Willy Nelson</li>
    <li>explore the Met museum before or after you stop by!</li>
    <li>Birthday presents optional</li>
</ul>
- <ul>
    <li>Join Kay in celebrating their 29th birthday with free food and beverages</li>
    <li>karaoke and a special appearance by Willy Nelson</li>
    <li>explore the Met museum before or after you stop by!</li>
    <li>Birthday presents optional</li>
</ul>

5.
Add index.html to the staging area.
- git add index.html

6.
Now make a commit.
- git commit -m "tasks file"

7.
Kay approves the changes you made in the unordered-list branch.

Switch over to master. Then, merge unordered-list into master. This will be a fast forward merge.
- git checkout master
- git merge unordered-list

8.
Kay wants the heading to be way bigger. Create a new branch called big-heading.
- git branch big-heading

9.
Now, switch over the big-heading branch.

To make the heading bigger, replace the line below:

<h1>Kay's Birthday Party</h1>

With this line:

<h1 style="font-size: 72px">Kay's Birthday Party</h1>
- git checkout big-heading branch
- <h1 style="font-size: 72px">Kay's Birthday Party</h1>

10.
Add index.html to the staging area.
- git add index.html

11.
Make a commit.
- git commit -m "updated html file"

12.
Kay approves of the giant heading!

Switch back over to the master branch. Then, merge big-heading into master.
- git checkout master
- git merge big-heading
